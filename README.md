# Robin-Migration-Distance
A script that uses the R package AssignR to designate nonbreeding location and migration distance for two populations of the American robin--one that breeds in Anchorage, AK, and the other that breeds in Bloomington, IN.
This script is modified code from collaborator Dr. Tara M. Smiley (tara.smiley@stonybrook.edu).

Inputs of AssignR include: (1) an isoscape with the relevant temporal and spatial extent. 
                           (2) a species range extent that the model will work within
                           (3) known-origin
