# Robin-Migration-Distance
This script is referenced in graduate student Susan Reed's M.S. thesis in Biology at Indiana University, summer 2024: "THESIS TITLE"

This script uses the R package AssignR to designate the nonbreeding location and migration distance of individuals from two populations of the American robin--one that breeds in Anchorage, AK, and the other that breeds in Bloomington, IN.

This script is modified code from collaborator Dr. Tara M. Smiley (tara.smiley@stonybrook.edu).

The AssignR requirements include: (1) an isoscape with the relevant temporal and spatial extent,
(2) the species range spatial extent or shapefile, 
(3) an isoscape that is temporally and spatially relevant to the tissue being modeled (here, overwintering claw tissue)
(4) known-origin samples
(5) unknown-origin samples
