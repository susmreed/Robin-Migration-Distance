# Robin-Migration-Distance
This script is referenced in graduate student Susan Reed's M.S. thesis in Biology at Indiana University, summer 2024: "THESIS TITLE"

This script uses the R package AssignR to designate the nonbreeding location and migration distance of individuals from two populations of the American robin--one that breeds in Anchorage, AK, and another that breeds in Bloomington, IN.

This script is modified code from collaborator Dr. Tara M. Smiley (tara.smiley@stonybrook.edu).

The AssignR requirements include:
(1) the species range spatial extent or shapefile, 
(2) a precipitation-weighted isoscape that is temporally and spatially relevant to the tissue being modeled (here, overwintering claw tissue)
(3) known-origin stable isotope values in .csv format
(4) unknown-origin stable isotope values in .csv format


To create requirement #2, a precip-weighted isoscape, follow file labeled " #1. Precip-weighted isoscape".
