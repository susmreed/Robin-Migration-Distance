# Robin_2023-Migration-Distance
This script is referenced in graduate student Susan Reed's M.S. thesis in Biology at Indiana University, summer 2024: "_________"

This script uses the "assignR" package in R Studio version 4.2.2 to designate the non-breeding location and migration distance of individuals from two populations of the American robin songbird, <em>Turdus migratorius</em> â€” one that breeds in Anchorage, AK, and another that breeds in Bloomington, IN.

This script is modified code from collaborator Dr. Tara M. Smiley (tara.smiley@stonybrook.edu).

<br>The assignR requirements include:</br>
<br> <b>(1)</b> the species range spatial extent or shapefile,</br>
<br> <b>(2)</b> a precipitation-weighted isoscape that is temporally and spatially relevant to the tissue being modeled (i.e., here, non-breeding period claw tissue),</br>
<br> <b>(3)</b> known-origin stable isotope values (likely referenced directly from the package), and </br>
<br> <b>(4)</b> unknown-origin stable isotope values in .csv format.</br>


If you do not have a precipitation-weighted isoscape, follow the script labeled <em>"#1. Precip-weighted isoscape"</em> to create the appropriate objects to run the assignR script.
